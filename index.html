        <p>
            Ronya Gettis grew up on a hobby farm in Southern Minnesota. She grew up competing in gymnastics throughout
            her school years. She also learned to ski at a young age during the cold winters in Minnesota. Eventually she
            decided to give snowboarding a try, which has followed her into her adult years. But the thing that brings Ronya
            the most joy, is traveling. She's been to many different countries, including Norway (twice), which is where 
            her great grandparents had immigrated from. Family is the most important thing to her. Which is why, at the age
            of 22, when she had moved to San Diego, she knew it wouldn't be permanent. Although she doesn't like giving up, 
            after 4 years of living out there, and showing herself that she could accomplish anything she set her mind to, 
            she decided it was time to move home, to be surrounded by her family.
            <br/>
            <br/>She started working at the age of 15, and has consistently worked at least one job since then. Often 
            times working multiple jobs. She has had many different job titles and positions. But when she started working 
            at her first restaurant job, she knew she'd stay in restaurants for a while. The fast pace of them was something
            she enjoyed. But she always had an interest and passion to one day study in the I.T field. She heard about an 
            online bootcamp to learn how to code and couldn't wait to enroll and get into the exciting world of Technology!
